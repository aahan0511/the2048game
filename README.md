# **`How To Play`**

</div>

- **Start the Game**: Begin with a 4x4 grid containing two numbered tiles, usually 2s or 4s. Your goal is to combine these tiles to create a tile with the number 2048.
- **Move Tiles**: Use the arrow keys (or W, A, S, D on a keyboard) to move all tiles on the grid in the chosen direction. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one tile with the sum of their values.
- **New Tiles**: After each move, a new tile (either 2 or 4) randomly appears on an empty space on the grid.
- **Continue Playing**: You can continue playing after reaching 2048, aiming for even higher numbers. The game ends when no more moves are possible, meaning the grid is full and no tiles can combine.
